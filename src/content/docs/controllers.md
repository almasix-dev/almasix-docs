description: Organize request handling into controller classes.

A **controller** is a class that answers one or more routes. Instead of putting
every handler inline in `routes/web.py`, group related actions under
`app/http/controllers/` so each file stays small and testable.

## Basic controllers

Subclass `Controller` and write async methods. Return a Prism view, JSON, a
redirect, or any shape the [Responses](/responses/) page covers:

```python title="app/http/controllers/welcome_controller.py"
from almasix.http import Controller
from almasix.prism import view


class WelcomeController(Controller):
    async def index(self):
        return view("welcome", {"title": "Almasix"})
```

Wire the action in a route file:

```python title="routes/web.py"
from app.http.controllers.welcome_controller import WelcomeController

from almasix.routing import Route

Route.get("/", [WelcomeController, "index"])
```

Generate a stub:

```bash title="terminal"
python smith make:controller PostController
python smith make:model Post -c      # model + plain controller
python smith make:model Post -mr     # model + migration + resource controller
```

Nested namespaces work (`python smith make:controller Admin/UserController`)
and create `__init__.py` files as needed.

## Dependency injection

Constructor and method dependencies are resolved from the application
container — type-hint what you need and Almasix builds it:

```python title="app/http/controllers/demo_controller.py"
from almasix.config import ConfigRepository
from almasix.http import Controller, Request


class DemoController(Controller):
    def __init__(self, config: ConfigRepository) -> None:
        self.config = config

    async def with_config(self, request: Request) -> dict:
        return {"app": self.config.get("app.name")}
```

Type-hint `Request` or a [`FormRequest`](/validation/) subclass to receive the
current request (validated when using FormRequest). Path parameters and bound
models arrive as extra method arguments — see [Routing](/routing/#route-model-binding).

## Resource-style methods

For CRUD resources, name methods after the seven resource actions (`index`,
`create`, `store`, `show`, `edit`, `update`, `destroy`) so
`Route.resource(...)` can wire them automatically. Prefer one public method per
intent. Almasix does not require invokable `__call__` controllers — use an
explicitly named method on the route.
