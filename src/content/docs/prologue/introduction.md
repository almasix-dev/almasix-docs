title: How to read these docs
description: Nouns, journey order, and where to go next if you are new to Almasix.
---

Almasix docs assume you know **Python** and the basics of the web (HTTP, HTML,
JSON). They do **not** assume you know another web framework.

## Words you will see

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Almasix** | The framework (`pipx install almasix` — global CLI; each app’s `.venv` holds the dependency) |
| **`almasix new`** | Creates a new application directory |
| **Smith** | The in-app CLI — prefer `python smith …` from the app root |
| **Articulate** | The ORM — models, queries, migrations |
| **Prism** | The template engine (`.prism.html` files) |
| **ASGI** | The async server interface Almasix apps run on (Uvicorn by default) |

## Inspired by Laravel

Almasix’s application layout, request lifecycle, FormRequest-style validation,
facades, ORM habits, queues, and console role (Smith) are **heavily inspired
by** [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) — Taylor Otwell’s PHP framework and the
community around it. We are grateful for that design tradition.

These docs still teach Almasix on its own terms in Python. You do not need to
know Laravel to follow along; if you already do, many shapes will feel familiar.

For how Almasix sits next to Django, FastAPI, Flask, Litestar, and Masonite, see
[Compared to other frameworks](/prologue/compared/).

## Code examples

Every example shows a **file path** above the code (the tab on the code block).
That path is where the snippet belongs in a typical app from `almasix new` —
for example `routes/web.py` or `app/http/controllers/post_controller.py`.
Shell commands use the path `terminal`.

Copy the idea into the matching file in your project; adjust names to fit.

## Suggested path

1. [Installation](/installation/) — create an app and open it in the browser
2. [Directory Structure](/structure/) — where files live
3. [Routing](/routing/) → [Controllers](/controllers/) → [Requests](/requests/) → [Responses](/responses/)
4. [Views](/views/) and the [Prism](/prism/) group when you render HTML
5. [Validation](/validation/), [Session](/session/), then [Authentication](/authentication/)
6. [Database](/database/) and [Articulate](/articulate/) when you persist data
7. [Deployment](/deployment/) before production

Sidebar groups fold; open **The Basics** and walk top to bottom.

## When something fails

- [Error Handling](/errors/) and [Logging](/logging/)
- [Testing](/testing/) for HTTP and console tests
