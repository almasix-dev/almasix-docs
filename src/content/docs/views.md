description: Render HTML with Prism from controllers and routes.
---

A **view** turns data from a controller into HTML. Almasix’s view engine is
**Prism**: templates under `resources/views` with a `.prism.html` extension,
compiled to Python and cached in the process. This page is the overview; the
full Prism tutorial lives under [Prism](/prism/).

## Creating and returning views

```python title="app/http/controllers/welcome_controller.py"
from almasix.prism import view


async def index(self):
    return view("welcome", {"title": "Almasix"})
```

Templates live under `resources/views`. Dots map to directories:
`view("posts.show")` → `resources/views/posts/show.prism.html`.

```html title="resources/views/welcome.prism.html"
@extends("layouts.app")

@section("content")
  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
@endsection
```

## Passing data

The second argument to `view()` is a dict of template data. Helpers such as
`url`, `asset`, `e`, and `__` are injected automatically for Prism templates.

## Escaping

| Syntax | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `{{ value }}` | HTML-escaped (safe default) |
| `{!! value !!}` | Raw HTML — only when you trust the content |

## When to use `html()`

[`html()`](/responses/) is for small hand-built fragments or low-level
responses. Prefer `view()` for pages, layouts, and components.
