title: Language server
description: almasix-lsp — completions, diagnostics, hover, and go-to-definition for Almasix apps.
---

**`almasix-lsp`** is the first-party language server for Almasix. One
implementation serves every editor that speaks LSP: VS Code / Cursor, Neovim,
Helix, Zed, and Sublime. **PyCharm / IntelliJ** use the native **Almasix Idea**
plugin (completions from `smith ide:index --json`) instead of this LSP client —
see [Editor setup](/editor-setup/).

It boots your application the same way Smith does, then answers questions a
type checker cannot: which views exist, which routes are named, which config
keys were loaded.

## Install

```bash title="terminal"
pip install 'almasix[lsp]'
# or with the full dev set
pip install 'almasix[dev]'
```

Both extras pull in `pygls` and `lsprotocol` (Python 3.11–3.13).

## Run the server

Any of these starts the stdio language server:

```bash title="terminal"
almasix-lsp
python -m almasix.lsp
smith lsp:serve          # from an application root
```

Editors launch the binary with the project virtualenv on `PATH`. Point the
client at the app root (the directory that contains `bootstrap/app.py`).

## What it indexes

On initialize (and again on save / `almasix.rebuildIndex`), the server:

1. Finds `bootstrap/app.py` (walks up from the workspace root; multi-root
   workspaces pick the first folder that contains one)
2. Boots the application — prefers `bootstrap.app.application` so middleware
   aliases match the HTTP kernel
3. Collects:
   - **Views** — every `*.prism.html` under `resources/views` (dotted names)
   - **Named routes** — from the live router, with best-effort file/line from
     `routes/*.py` (falls back to `web.py` / `api.py`)
   - **Config keys** — flattened dotted keys from `config/*.py`
   - **Models** — module stems under `app/models`
   - **Translation keys** — from `lang/<locale>/*.py`, `lang/<locale>.json`,
     and best-effort PHP arrays when `lang/` exists
   - **Middleware aliases** — framework defaults plus
     `http.middleware_aliases` from bootstrap
   - **View context** — keys from `view("name", {…})` call sites, built-in
     Prism helpers (`url`, `route`, `csrf_token`, …), and shared composers

If boot fails, the client gets a clear error message instead of a silent empty
index.

## Capabilities

| Feature | Surfaces |
| --- | --- |
| **Completion** | `view("…")`, `@include` / `@extends`, `route("…")`, `config("…")`, `__()` / `trans()` / `@lang`, `.middleware("…")`, `[Controller, "…"]` action methods, **Prism `{{ name }}` globals / view data**, `@directive` names, **`route`/`route_is`/`vite`/`url`/`asset` strings anywhere in a template**, **`env("…")` keys and dotenv `${…}`**, **table / column names from migrations + models**, **model instance attributes (`user.email`)**, and — when invoked explicitly in plain markup — the whole directive + globals list |
| **Go to definition** | `view("foo.bar")` → template; `route("name")` → routes file; `config("app.x")` → `config/app.py`; `[Controller, "method"]` → controller method; **`{{ app_name }}` → controller data key**; **`url`/`route`/`vite` helpers → source / entry**; **`env("APP_NAME")` → `.env` line**; **`DB.table("posts")` / `.where("slug")` → migration / model** |
| **Find references** | View names — `view("…")` / `@include` / `@extends` across the app |
| **Document links** | View, route, config, and controller-action string arguments |
| **Code actions** | Create missing view (empty `.prism.html`) for unknown-view diagnostics |
| **Formatting** | `.prism.html` via `format_prism` (same as `smith prism:format`) — full document and range requests |

Trigger characters: `"`, `'`, `.`, `@`, `$`. `{` is deliberately not one: editors
auto-close `{{` into `{{  }}`, and a popup mid-brace fights that. Inside an
echo, completion comes from the first typed letter or from Ctrl+Space, which in
a Prism file always has something to offer. `$` opens env-key completion inside
a dotenv `${…}` reference.

### Environment keys

The index reads `.env`, every `.env.*` beside it (`.env.example` is the
convention), and every `env("KEY", …)` call under `config/` / `bootstrap/`. Keys
that only appear in config still complete — that is the key someone forgot to
document. Hover shows the value for non-secret keys and redacts anything whose
name looks like a password / token / key (same policy as `smith config:show`).

### Database schema

Tables and columns come from `database/migrations` (applied in filename order, so
a later `Schema.table` alteration wins) plus each model's `fillable` / `casts`.
`DB.table("…")`, `Schema.create` / `drop` / `has_column`, and query-builder
methods (`.where`, `.order_by`, `.select`, …) complete against that map; a
`Post.where("…")` resolves the model class to its table. Live inspection is
**opt-in** via `ALMASIX_LSP_DB_SCHEMA=1` so a language server never dials a
remote database on every save.

Rebuild the index from the client with the `almasix.rebuildIndex` command, or
by saving a document. Creating a view via the code action refreshes the index.

## Editor wiring

### VS Code / Cursor / VSCodium

Install the official extension from the Visual Studio Marketplace or a Release
VSIX (see [Editor setup](/editor-setup/)). Source:
[`almasix-dev/almasix-vscode`](https://github.com/almasix-dev/almasix-vscode).

Or, until the extension is installed, a minimal `settings.json`:

```json title="examples/language-server.json"
{
  "almasix.pythonPath": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python"
}
```

Associate `*.prism.html` with language id `prism-html` so hover on directives works
(see [Prism language support](/prism-language/)).

### Neovim (nvim-lspconfig)

```lua title="examples/language-server.lua"
vim.lsp.config("almasix_lsp", {
  cmd = { "almasix-lsp" },
  filetypes = { "python", "html" },
  root_markers = { "bootstrap/app.py" },
})
vim.lsp.enable("almasix_lsp")
```

### Helix

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[language-server.almasix-lsp]
command = "almasix-lsp"

[[language]]
name = "python"
language-servers = ["almasix-lsp", "pylsp"]
```

### Zed

```json title="examples/language-server.json"
{
  "languages": {
    "Python": {
      "language_servers": ["almasix-lsp", "..."]
    }
  },
  "lsp": {
    "almasix-lsp": {
      "binary": { "path": "almasix-lsp" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Library API

```python title="examples/language-server.py"
from almasix.lsp import build_index, create_server, find_app_root

index = build_index("/path/to/app")   # or find_app_root()
print(len(index.views), len(index.routes), len(index.config_keys))

server = create_server()              # pygls LanguageServer
# server.start_io()
```

`build_index` is usable without starting the LSP process — handy for scripts
or tests that only need the symbol table.

## Try it in your app

From your application root (the directory with `bootstrap/app.py`):

```bash title="terminal"
smith lsp:serve
# or:
almasix-lsp
```

Wire the binary into your editor as shown above. To inspect what was indexed
without an editor, call `build_index(".")` from a short script and print
`len(index.views)`, `len(index.routes)`, and so on.

## Scope notes

Shipped for day-to-day editing: views, routes, config, translations,
middleware aliases, find-references for views, and a create-view code action.
Not yet shipped: disk / queue / cache / gate / relation / column / component
completions, Prism structural diagnostics, rename, Starlight-sourced hover,
and filesystem watchers. Editor packaging is on [Editor setup](/editor-setup/).
