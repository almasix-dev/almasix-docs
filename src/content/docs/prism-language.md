title: Prism language support
description: TextMate and tree-sitter grammars, snippets, and smith prism:format for .prism.html templates.
---

Prism templates use the `.prism.html` extension. Almasix ships a first-party
formatter in the framework, and editor grammar assets in
[`almasix-dev/ide-support`](https://github.com/almasix-dev/ide-support) (`prism/`), so
every tool — editors, pre-commit, CI — shares one language surface.

The Prism mark (optical prism + spectrum) lives in
[`art/prism/`](https://github.com/almasix-dev/almasix/tree/main/art/prism) —
use `prism-file.svg` for `.prism.html` file icons in editor packages.

Full VS Code / JetBrains packaging is covered in [Editor setup](/editor-setup/).

## Grammar (TextMate)

[`prism/syntaxes/prism.tmLanguage.json`](https://github.com/almasix-dev/ide-support/blob/main/prism/syntaxes/prism.tmLanguage.json)
highlights:

- HTML host markup
- Escaped echoes `{{ … }}` and raw echoes `{!! … !!}`
- Comments `{{-- … --}}`
- `@python` / `@endpython` blocks as embedded Python
- Directives: `@if` / `@elseif` / `@else` / `@unless` / `@isset` / `@empty` /
  `@for` / `@foreach` / `@forelse` / `@while`, layout and includes,
  components and slots, stacks, auth / gates, `@csrf` / `@asset` / `@lang` /
  `@choice` / `@cache` / `@dump` / `@dd` / `@vite` / `@route`, and matching
  `@end*` closers

Scope name: `text.html.prism`.

## Language configuration

[`prism/language-configuration.json`](https://github.com/almasix-dev/ide-support/blob/main/prism/language-configuration.json)
sets:

- Block comments `{{--` / `--}}`
- Auto-closing pairs for echoes and brackets
- Folding markers on open / close directives
- Indentation rules for directives and HTML tags

## Snippets

[`prism/snippets/prism.code-snippets`](https://github.com/almasix-dev/ide-support/blob/main/prism/snippets/prism.code-snippets)
covers common directives (`@if`, `@foreach`, `@section`, `@auth`, `@python`, …)
plus `<x-…>` components and slots.

## Tree-sitter

[`prism/tree-sitter-prism/`](https://github.com/almasix-dev/ide-support/tree/main/prism/tree-sitter-prism)
is a minimal grammar that recognizes `comment`, `echo`, `raw_echo`,
`directive`, and `html_text`, with `queries/highlights.scm` for Neovim /
Helix / Zed. Build steps are documented in the
[ide-support `prism/README.md`](https://github.com/almasix-dev/ide-support/blob/main/prism/README.md).

## Formatter

Library entry point (framework package):

```python title="examples/prism-language.py"
from almasix.prism.formatter import format_prism

formatted = format_prism(source, indent_size=4, line_length=120)
```

The formatter is **idempotent** and directive-aware. It indents HTML-ish
structure and Prism directives. Content between `@python` and `@endpython` is
**not** reindented.

CLI (registered by `PrismServiceProvider`):

```bash title="terminal"
smith prism:format                      # write under cwd
smith prism:format resources/views      # directory or file
smith prism:format --check              # CI: fail if would change
```

`--write` is the default when `--check` is not set.
