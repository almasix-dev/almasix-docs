title: Broadcasting
description: Send server-side events to the browser over Sonar — channels, authorization, presence, model broadcasting, and alternative realtime drivers.
---

## Introduction

An event happens on the server and a browser needs to know about it: a post is
published, an order ships, someone joins a room. Broadcasting takes an event
you already dispatch and puts it on a channel that connected clients are
listening to.

```python title="examples/broadcasting.py"
from almasix.broadcasting import PrivateChannel, ShouldBroadcast


class OrderShipped(ShouldBroadcast):
    def __init__(self, order):
        self.order = order

    def broadcast_on(self):
        return [PrivateChannel(f"orders.{self.order.id}")]
```

```python title="examples/broadcasting.py"
from almasix.broadcasting import broadcast

broadcast(OrderShipped(order)).to_others()
```

That is the whole contract: an event that inherits `ShouldBroadcast` and names
its channels. Dispatching it — with `broadcast()`, `Event.dispatch()`, or the
`event()` helper — puts the broadcast on the queue and runs your listeners as
usual.

## Configuration

`config/broadcasting.py` names the connections, and `BROADCAST_CONNECTION`
picks the one in use. A new application defaults to `log`, which writes each
broadcast to the log and sends nothing — the application is broadcastable
before you have decided how the browser hears about it.

| Driver | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `log` | Writes the event, the channels, and the payload to the log |
| `null` | Accepts and discards — the off switch |
| `websocket` / `sonar` | **Sonar** — Almasix's own socket server, in the application process |
| `redis` | Publishes to Redis for a socket server to relay |
| `pusher` | Posts to Pusher Channels over its REST API |

`sonar` is a product alias for the same in-process server as `websocket`. Use
either connection name; both register `/broadcasting/socket` when selected as
the default.

`Broadcast.extend("mine", resolver)` registers a driver of your own; the
resolver is called with the connection name and its configuration and returns
a `Broadcaster`.

## Sonar (default realtime)

**Sonar** is Almasix's first-party realtime stack: the in-process websocket
server plus the `@almasix/sonar` browser client. It does **not** require
`pusher-js`, Ably, or Socket.IO.

### Server

With `BROADCAST_CONNECTION=websocket` or `sonar`, the application serves Sonar
at `/broadcasting/socket` — no third party, no separate process.

```python title="routes/web.py"
Route.websocket("/live", MyHandler())     # your own sockets, same router
```

The protocol is small:

| Direction | Frame |
| --- | --- |
| server → client | `almasix:connection_established` with the `socket_id` |
| client → server | `subscribe` with `channel`, plus `auth` when private |
| server → client | `almasix:subscription_succeeded`, with `members` on presence |
| client → server | `unsubscribe`, `ping` |
| server → client | `almasix:member_added`, `almasix:member_removed`, `almasix:pong` |
| server → client | the broadcast itself: `{event, channel, data}` |

A client may also send `client-*` events, which are forwarded to the rest of
a private channel it has joined. They are off unless the connection's
`client_events` is true.

One process serves its own connections. More than one worker means each
worker only reaches the browsers attached to it; put Redis in front, or use a
hosted alternative below, when you scale past one.

### `@almasix/sonar` client

```bash title="terminal"
npm install @almasix/sonar
```

```js title="resources/views/examples/broadcasting.prism.html"
import Sonar from "@almasix/sonar";

const sonar = new Sonar({
  // defaults: same host as the page, path /broadcasting/socket
  // authEndpoint: "/broadcasting/auth",
});

await sonar.connect();

sonar.channel("announcements").listen("post.published", (payload) => {
  console.log(payload);
});

sonar.private(`orders.${orderId}`).listen("OrderShipped", (payload) => {
  console.log(payload);
});

sonar
  .join("rooms.lobby")
  .here((members) => console.log(members))
  .joining((member) => console.log("joined", member))
  .leaving((member) => console.log("left", member));

// Exclude this tab from server broadcasts (`to_others()`)
fetch("/orders", {
  method: "POST",
  credentials: "include",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    ...sonar.socketIdHeader(), // X-Socket-ID
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ ... }),
});
```

Private and presence channels POST `/broadcasting/auth` with cookies
(`credentials: "include"`). The socket id is available as `sonar.socketId` for
`to_others()`.

See the [`@almasix/sonar` README](https://github.com/almasix-dev/almasix-sonar#readme) for options (`wsUrl`, `forceTLS`, reconnect).

### Raw WebSocket (no package)

```js title="resources/js/examples/broadcasting.js"
const socket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8000/broadcasting/socket");

socket.onmessage = (message) => {
    const frame = JSON.parse(message.data);

    if (frame.event === "almasix:connection_established") {
        socketId = frame.data.socket_id;
        socket.send(JSON.stringify({
            event: "subscribe",
            data: { channel: "announcements" },
        }));
    }
};
```

## Defining broadcast events

Inherit `ShouldBroadcast` and name the channels. Everything else has a
default:

```python title="examples/broadcasting.py"
class PostPublished(ShouldBroadcast):
    def __init__(self, post):
        self.post = post

    def broadcast_on(self):
        return [Channel("announcements"), PrivateChannel(self.post.author)]

    def broadcast_as(self):        # default: the class name
        return "post.published"

    def broadcast_with(self):      # default: the public attributes
        return {"id": self.post.id, "title": self.post.title}

    def broadcast_when(self):      # default: always
        return self.post.published
```

Without `broadcast_with()`, the payload is every public attribute of the
event, models serialized with `to_dict()`, plus `socket`. Without
`broadcast_as()`, the name is the class name — Python module paths are not
what a JavaScript file wants to type.

### Queued, immediate, and after-commit

`ShouldBroadcast` events go through the queue, on `broadcast_queue` and
`broadcast_connection` if the event names them. Two variants change when:

| Marker | When it goes out |
| --- | --- |
| `ShouldBroadcast` | Queued, as a `BroadcastEvent` job |
| `ShouldBroadcastNow` | During dispatch, no queue involved |
| `ShouldBroadcastAfterCommit` | Queued, but not until the transaction commits |

A queued broadcast captures its channels and payload at dispatch time, so
what sits on the queue is plain JSON that any driver can carry.

### Choosing connections at runtime

Mix in `InteractsWithBroadcasting` and the event can pick:

```python title="examples/broadcasting.py"
broadcast(OrderShipped(order)).via("pusher")
```

### Leaving the current user out

Mix in `InteractsWithSockets`. Sonar sends an `X-Socket-ID` header once it has
connected, and `to_others()` reads it:

```python title="examples/broadcasting.py"
broadcast(OrderShipped(order)).to_others()   # everyone on the channel but me
```

## Channels

| Class | Prefix | Who may listen |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Channel` | — | Anyone connected |
| `PrivateChannel` | `private-` | Whoever your callback allows |
| `PresenceChannel` | `presence-` | Same, and members see each other |
| `EncryptedPrivateChannel` | `private-encrypted-` | Same, payload sealed with the app key |

A channel can be named after a model, which is what makes model broadcasting
read well: `PrivateChannel(post)` is `private-app.models.post.Post.1`, and a
model may override `broadcast_channel()` to shorten that.

### Authorizing channels

`routes/channels.py` says who may listen to what. The broadcasting provider
loads it, so channels exist in console runs too:

```python title="resources/views/examples/broadcasting.prism.html"
from almasix.broadcasting import Broadcast


@Broadcast.channel("orders.{order}")
def order_channel(user, order: Order):
    return order.user_id == user.get_key()
```

Annotate a parameter with a model and Almasix looks the row up before calling
you — the same binding a route gets. A record that does not exist refuses the
subscription rather than raising.

A channel class is the other spelling, resolved from the container:

```python title="examples/broadcasting.py"
Broadcast.channel("orders.{order}", OrderChannel)   # smith make:channel OrderChannel
```

Return `True` to allow, anything falsey to refuse, and — on a presence
channel — a dict, which becomes the member information everyone else sees. A
pattern nobody registered is refused: silence is not consent.

`Broadcast.channel(..., guards=["web", "api"])` picks which guards may
authenticate the request; the default is whatever `request.user()` returns.

Run `smith channel:list` to see what is registered.

## The authorization endpoints

The provider adds these, unless `broadcasting.routes` is `False`:

| Route | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /broadcasting/auth` | May this socket join this channel? |
| `POST /broadcasting/user-auth` | Who is this socket? |

Both answer in a signed format shared with Pusher-shaped clients — an `auth`
string of `key:signature`, plus `channel_data` for presence. The signature is
HMAC-SHA256 over `socket_id:channel[:channel_data]`, signed with the
connection's `secret`, falling back to `APP_KEY`.

`broadcasting.middleware` decides what runs in front of them; the default is
`["web"]`, because that is where sessions live.

## Model broadcasting

Mix `BroadcastsEvents` into a model, before `Model`, and its writes broadcast
themselves:

```python title="app/models/example.py"
class Post(BroadcastsEvents, Model):
    def broadcast_on(self, event: str):
        return [] if event == "deleted" else [self, self.author]
```

`broadcast_on()` is asked for `created`, `updated`, `trashed`, `restored`, and
`deleted`; returning `[]` keeps that one quiet. Returning the model means its
own private channel.

The event is named for the model and the change — `PostUpdated` — and carries
`{"model": ...}`, unless the model defines `broadcast_as(event)` or
`broadcast_with(event)`. Set `broadcasts_now = True` to skip the queue, or
inherit `BroadcastsEventsAfterCommit` to wait for the transaction.

## Broadcast notifications

`broadcast` is a notification channel like any other:

```python title="examples/broadcasting.py"
class InvoicePaid(Notification):
    def via(self, notifiable):
        return ["database", "broadcast"]

    def to_broadcast(self, notifiable):
        return {"invoice": self.invoice.id, "amount": self.invoice.total}
```

It goes to the notifiable's own private channel — or wherever
`route_notification_for_broadcast()` says — as
`BroadcastNotificationCreated`, with the notification's id and type included.

## Testing

`Broadcast.fake()` points every connection at a recorder:

```python title="examples/broadcasting.py"
fake = Broadcast.fake()

broadcast(OrderShipped(order)).send()
await flush_broadcasts()

fake.assert_broadcast("OrderShipped")
fake.assert_broadcast_on("OrderShipped", "private-orders.1")
fake.assert_broadcast_count(1)
fake.assert_not_broadcast("OrderCancelled")
```

Dispatch hands a broadcast to the event loop and returns, so a test that is
about to assert should `await flush_broadcasts()` first. `Event.fake()` still
swallows the whole event, broadcast included.

## Alternatives (not the default)

Sonar is the default path. These clients and backends remain supported when
you already use them or need a hosted bus.

### Pusher.js

Use the `pusher` broadcaster (`PUSHER_*` env) so the server posts to Pusher
Channels. In the browser, use [`pusher-js`](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js)
(or any Pusher-compatible client) against your Pusher app credentials.
Channel auth still hits Almasix at `POST /broadcasting/auth`.

### Ably

Point a custom / Redis-fed socket layer or an Ably-compatible bridge at your
channels, and use the [Ably JavaScript client](https://ably.com/docs/getting-started/javascript)
in the browser. Authorization can still reuse `/broadcasting/auth` if your
bridge expects Pusher-shaped signatures; otherwise authorize with Ably's own
token flow and keep Almasix as the event publisher only.

### Socket.IO

Run a Socket.IO server (or a Redis subscriber that emits into Socket.IO) and
subscribe with the [Socket.IO client](https://socket.io/docs/v4/client-api/).
Almasix's native Sonar protocol is not Socket.IO; treat this as a separate
realtime plane fed by the `redis` or `log` broadcaster, not as a drop-in for
`/broadcasting/socket`.

## Design notes

- **Marker, not interface.** `ShouldBroadcast` is a base class you inherit;
  Python has no interfaces to implement.
- **Sonar by default.** Almasix ships Sonar in-process and `@almasix/sonar` for
  the browser; Pusher, Ably, and Socket.IO stay documented alternatives.
- **Names default to the class name**, not the fully qualified path.
- **Payloads are captured at dispatch**, not rebuilt when the job runs,
  because queue payloads here are JSON rather than serialized objects.
- **`flush_broadcasts()`** exists because dispatch is synchronous and the send
  is not — the event loop needs a place to drain pending broadcasts.
